\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{
In this project, an analysis of a single speaker in low/mid frequency is done. The analysis compare the analytical model with a measurement of the speaker. The gold is to design a directional speaker array.  The analysis include the well known first order gradient speaker and a three speaker model. The three speaker model is chosen because the first order gradient speaker model is not able to direct the pressure in any direction as the three speaker model might be. This project only deals with beamforming in the frontal direction of the array but by changing the filters, the array can change the beamforming angle. It is found out that the acoustical center is in front of the speaker and it is the placement for the acoustical center which is the important. An genetic algorithm is chosen to optimize the position of the acoustical center, and to design the beamforming software an \gls{iir} and \gls{fir} filter is chosen and optimized by modifying the genetic algorithm. The final result and measurement is compared with a commercial product.
