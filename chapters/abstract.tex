\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{

The paper deals with the creation of different sound effects for an electric guitar on the a Digital Signal Processor. Some of these effects are the reverb, the flanger and the equalizer. 
The report includes a thorough explanation of each of the effects followed by the used design approach. Simulations on MATLAB were done to verify the design. All the effects have been coded in assembly for the DSP implementation.  The Assembly code works with the TMS320C5515 DSP from Texas Instruments. 
In order to make the DSP usable on a variety of electric guitars, a preamplifier was built. All details relating to the design and the implementation of this component are included in the paper as well.
