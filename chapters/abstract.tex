This project deals with low/mid frequency directivity control.
The directional characteristics of a single loudspeaker and position of its acoustic center are characterised. An analytical model of the loudspeaker is established to model a beamforming array. After pointing out some properties of the commonly known first order gradient source, a three speaker array is designed. Three speakers are chosen to overcome the disadvantage of the first order gradient speaker not being able to freely control its main lobe direction. To predict the behaviour of the speaker array in a non-free-field environment, a numerical model is set up.  A genetic algorithm is chosen to optimize gain and phase for the individual loudspeakers. A suitable positioning scheme for the speakers is established. Required signal processing parameters are implemented as filters. The measured directional characteristics of the array are compared with the analytical and numerical models and compared with the directional characteristics of a commercial product.
