\chapter{Measurement of Directional Characteristics II}\label{ax:directional_2}
This appendix serves as a protocol to a series of measurements conducted on the 2\textsuperscript{nd} of March 2018 in the large anechoic chamber (B4-111) at the acoustical lab of Aalborg University at Fredrik Bajers Vej 7.\\
The goal of these measurements was to quantify the directional characteristics of the loudspeakers that will be used in the loudspeaker array. The results are useful to show, what assumptions can be made when the speaker array is set up and where the position of the acoustic center is in relation to the cabinet. They will also serve as a baseline to which the directional characteristics of the speaker array can be compared. Furthermore, more experience can be gained regarding the practical aspects of measurement.

\section*{Setup}
A sketch of the measurement setup can be found in \autoref{fig:measurement_setup}. A picture is given in \autoref{fig:setup_03_02}. \\
According to the findings from \autoref{ax:directional_1} the cabinet had to be backwards from the center of the turntable in order to get the acoustic center of the loudspeaker on the rotational axis. This put up a considerable challenge on the mechanical side.
The 13'' loudspeaker and the cabinet add up to a comparatively large mass. The further they are moved away from the center of the turntable, the more significant are the issues arise, caused by leverage and inertia. This also manifests in \autoref{sec:03_02_results}.
In order to place the the speaker away from the center of the turntable, a circular plane with a diameter of \SI{800}{\milli\meter} was cut out of \SI{12}{\milli\meter} thick \gls{mdf} board and mounted to the turntable. In order to minimize the influence of reflections from the \gls{mdf} board on the measurement, the speaker was raised by \SI{1}{\meter} utilizing wooden pillars. The board on which the loudspeaker rests has the same (400x400)\SI{}{\milli\meter} size as the bottom side of the cabinet. This allows for minor positioning adjustments.\\
Both the microphone and the loudspeaker hat a vertical distance of \SI{1.32}{\meter} to the metal grids on which they were standing. The microphone was placed on the main axis of the loudspeaker. The horizontal distance between the front plane of the speaker cabinet and the microphone membrane was \SI{2.74}{\meter}.
The gain potentiometer of the power amplifier was set to \SI{-16}{\decibel} and the \texttt{playgain}-parameter (see XXXXXXX) was set to \SI{-18}{\decibel}.
