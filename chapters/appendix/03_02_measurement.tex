\chapter{Measurement of Directional Characteristics II}\label{ax:directional_2}
This appendix serves as a protocol to a series of measurements conducted on the 2\textsuperscript{nd} of March 2018 in the large anechoic chamber (B4-111) at the acoustical lab of Aalborg University at Fredrik Bajers Vej 7.\\
The goal of these measurements was to quantify the directional characteristics of the loudspeakers that will be used in the loudspeaker array. The results are useful to show, what assumptions can be made when the speaker array is set up and where the position of the acoustic center is in relation to the cabinet. They will also serve as a baseline to which the directional characteristics of the speaker array can be compared. Furthermore, more experience can be gained regarding the practical aspects of measurement.
