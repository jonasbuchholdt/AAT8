\chapter*{Test a guitars frequency area}
In this appendix the beamwidth calculation software will be briefly explained. The gold of the software is to find the $-n$\si{\decibel} beamwidth of an arbitrary speaker, where the polar response is measured. 

\section*{Materials}
To calculate the $-n$\si{\decibel} beamwidth, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item MATLAB 2017b (PC - software)
\end{itemize}


\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:measurement_setup}.
\item The polar response is measured according to \autoref{appendix:measuring_manual}
\item  
\item  
\item 
\item 
\end{enumerate}
