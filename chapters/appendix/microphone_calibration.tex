\chapter*{Test a guitars frequency area}
In this appendix the calibration software will be briefly explained. The gold of this software is to be able to calibrate the microphone setup including the soundcard and MATLAB, scuher that a calibration tone correspond to a known digital number in MATLAB. 

\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the .... on a guitar, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (Oscilloscope)
\item Fender Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster (Guitar)
\item Digilent Waveforms 2015 (PC - software)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:appendix:test}.

\section*{Results}

%		\label{fig:appendix:low_E_neck}
%\end{figure}

On  \autoref{fig:appendix:low_E_neck} it is seen that the lowest significant frequency is around \SI{80}{\hertz} and the highest significant frequency is around \SI{400}{\hertz}, when playing the low E note on the guitar, using the neck pickup.
