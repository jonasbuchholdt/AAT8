\chapter*{Transfer function measurement software}
In this appendix the transfer function software will be briefly explained. The gold of this software is to be able to compute the impulse response of a \gls{dut} using the logarithmic swept sine method and then compute the transfer function from the impulse response. To be able to send out a logarithmic swept sine and measure it, a full duplex soundcard have to be chosen and used as the measuring soundcard. To be able to reproduce all measurement and compare other measurement, the soundcard will not be changed doing the project work.

\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure transfer function of a \gls{dut}, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item RME FIREFACE ucx (Soundcard)
\item MATLAB (PC - software)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:appendix:test}.

\section*{Results}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{guitar_low_E_neck.pdf}
		\caption{Measurement of the low E note on the neck pickup.}
		\label{fig:appendix:low_E_neck}
\end{figure}

On  \autoref{fig:appendix:low_E_neck} it is seen that the lowest significant frequency is around \SI{80}{\hertz} and the highest significant frequency is around \SI{400}{\hertz}, when playing the low E note on the guitar, using the neck pickup.
