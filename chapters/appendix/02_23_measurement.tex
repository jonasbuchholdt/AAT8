\chapter{Measurement of Directional Characteristics I}\label{ax:directional_1}
This appendix serves as a protocol to a series of measurements conducted on the 23\textsuperscript{rd} of February 2018 in the large anechoic chamber (B4-111) at the acoustical lab of Aalborg University at Fredrik Bajers Vej 7.\\
The goal of these measurements was to try out and evaluate a MATLAB-based measurement routine to quantify the directional characteristic of loudspeakers, especially gaining experience with determining the acoustical center of a loudspeaker.

\section*{Setup}
A sketch of the measurement setup can be found in \autoref{fig:measurement_setup}. A picture is given in \autoref{fig:setup_02_23}

The horizontal distance between the microphone and the edge of the cabinet was \SI{0.75}{\meter}. This rather short distance was deliberately chosen for the sake of testing the measurement setup and getting an idea of the position of the acoustic center of the speaker. Directivity measurements should be conducted in the far field. In the frequency range that this project is covering, this means, that loudspeaker and microphone have to be placed significantly further apart. Because of the early stage of development, in which the measurement routine was at the point in time, that the measurement took place, no output calibration was applied. This means, that all measurement results are only relative and have no link to physical units that have been measured.

\section*{Results}
The measurement results have to be viewed remembering, that this measurement series has to be considered a practice run before the actual measurement to characterize the directivity characteristics of the speaker. \autoref{fig:02_23_pressure} shows the results of a measurement conducted at a distance of \SI{0.75}{\meter} to the front edge of the speaker. The \gls{spl} normated to the level on the main axis is displayed along the radial coordinate. The angular coordinate describes the position of the microphone in relation to the main axis of the speaker. The coloured lines relate to different frequencies.
The shape of the \SI{60}{\hertz} curve appears to be quite similar to the of a circle. However, it is not concentric with the pole. Two reasons seem likely
