\chapter{Measurement of Directional Characteristics III}\label{ax:directional_3}
This appendix serves as a protocol to a series of measurements conducted between the 10\textsuperscript{th} and 12\textsuperscript{th} of May  2018 in the large anechoic chamber (B4-111) at the acoustic lab of Aalborg University at Fredrik Bajers Vej 7.\\
The goal of these measurements is investigating the behaviour of a loudspeaker array consisting of three of the loudspeakers that have been featured in \autoref{ax:directional_1} and \ref{ax:directional_2}.

\section*{Setup}
When setting up the speaker array according to dimensions that have been decided upon in \autoref{sec:opt_result}, a substential effort was undertaken to insure a secure stance. The turntable was mounted to one of the platform grids used in the anechoic chamber by screwing bolts through a \gls{mdf}-plate and the grid into the threads on the underside of the turntable. A round \gls{mdf} plate was mounted using the boltpattern on the upside of the turntable. Fixed to the round plate a custom made steel contraption (\autoref{fig:speakerstand}) was bolted, which itself held the legs of the speakers in place. while allowing some adjustability. In a height of approx \SI{1}{\meter} above the turntable the three speaker cabinets were mounted to the legs. On top of the speaker a triangular \gls{mdf} cutout was employed to enhance rigidity. A picture of the array is given in \autoref{fig:05_11_setup}.

The height of the centers of the speaker cabinet above the grid turned out to be \SI{1.37}{\meter}. The microphone was set up in the same height. The horizontal distancedistance between the array center and the microphone was \SI{4.92}{\meter}.
The input and the output gain of the \gls{bandk} 2636 microphone power supply were both set to \SI{+10}{\decibel}. The input gain on the Fireface UCX was set to \SI{0}{\decibel}. On the playback side, the power amplifiers had a fixed voltage gain of \SI{+10}{\decibel} and the \texttt{playgain}-parameter in the measurement routine was set to \SI{-10}{\decibel}. The playback signals were normed so that the absolute of the biggest amplitude in on of the filtered sweeps (see \autoref{sec:filter_design} is a digital value of 1.
