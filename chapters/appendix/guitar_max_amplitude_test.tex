\chapter{Test of the Guitar's Maximum Amplitude}\label{app:guitar_max_amplitude}

A test is made to obtain the maximum output amplitude of the guitar.

\section*{Materials and Setup}
To measure the maximum output amplitude of the guitar, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Digilent Analog Discovery 2 (Oscilloscope)
\item Fender Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster (Guitar)
\item Digilent Waveforms 2015 (PC - software)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test Procedure}
To measure the maximum output amplitude of the guitar, the following steps are made:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:appendix:guitar_amplitude}.
\item Digilent Waveforms 2015 is set as a scope. 
\item The guitar is set to use the bridge pickup and the volume control and the tone control are turned all the way up to their maximum.
\item The highest amplitude for the guitar string is made by using a pick on all strings together.
\item The data is plotted in MATLAB.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}

\end{figure}

On  \autoref{fig:appendix:guitar_max_amplitude} it is seen that the highest amplitude is $\SI{1}{\volt}_{peak}$.
