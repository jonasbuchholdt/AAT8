\chapter*{Frequency response of RME FIREFACE ucx}
A test was made to get a view of the frequency response of the RME FIREFACE ucx. The RME FIREFACE ucx is used for all measurement in this project, and therefore the frequency response is of interest. 

\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the frequency response of the RME FIREFACE ucx, the following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item RME FIREFACE ucx (Soundcard)
\item MATLAB 2017b (PC - Software)
\item jack to jack cable
\end{itemize}

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:appendix:test}.

\section*{Results}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{guitar_low_E_neck.pdf}
		\caption{Measurement of the low E note on the neck pickup.}
		\label{fig:appendix:low_E_neck}
\end{figure}

On  \autoref{fig:appendix:low_E_neck} it is seen that the lowest significant frequency is around \SI{80}{\hertz} and the highest significant frequency is around \SI{400}{\hertz}, when playing the low E note on the guitar, using the neck pickup.
