\section{Comparison to a Commercial Product}
In order to get an idea of what directional characteristics have been achieved by others, the beamforming array is compared to a line array unit by the company D\&B, who specifically use their directivity control for marketing. The so called GLS8 unit is depicted in \autoref{fig:gls8_pic}. For the frequency range of this project, the key data is, that in the line array unit, two 14$^{\prime \prime}$ drivers in the front of the unit are placed, and another two 10$^{\prime \prime}$ drivers are mounted in the sides \citep{SL_GSL}[p. 6].

\end{figure}
The directional characteristics of the GSL8 units are depicted in \autoref{fig:gls_iso}. 
It has to be noted that this plot covers a significantly wider frequency range, than the one featured in this project. Between \SI{200}{\hertz} and \SI{300}{\hertz}, the line array unit clearly has a smaller \SI{-6}{\decibel} lobe width (approx. \SI{80}{\degree}) than the triangular array (approx. \SI{140}{\degree}), which is featured in \autoref{fig:array_iso}.
\autoref{fig:gls_iso} shows, that the lobe width for the line array module has a tendency to grow with decreasing frequency. At \SI{63}{\hertz} the \SI{-6}{\decibel} lobe width of the GSL8 unit is approx. \SI{144}{\degree}, which is in the same order of magnitude as the approx. \SI{150}{\degree} lobe width of the triangular array. When looking at these plots it has to be taken into account, that the two constructions were designed to fulfill different requirements and have very different cabinet configurations. It might be speculated, that perhaps the relatively large single cabinet of the line array unit aids directionality at higher frequencies, where at the lower end of the frequency band more of the directionality control has to be achieved by beamforming. This would explain, why at higher frequencies the lobe width of the GSL8 is clearly superior to the triangular array, while they both have similar characteristics around \SI{60}{\hertz}.

\section{Applications}\label{sec:applications}
\subsection{Home application}
The beamforming array might be quite big for home application, but it may be possible to reduce the size of the beamforming array with smaller speaker units. At this point there are several possibility for home application. Imagen that the house is designed and built as an open living environment, where the kitchen and the living room is a combined open area. There might be a television with stereo speakers in the living room where the back for the television and the back of speaker points towards the kitchen. The low frequency might be an issue backwards because a low frequency driver radiate omnidirectional. At higher frequency the power is more radiated agents the person that watch television, because the high frequency driver is cardioid in it self, only the reflection reflect back to the kitchen. Because of this directionality, there might be higher pressure in the kitchen of the low frequency than the high frequency. Therefore the sound might be annoying in the kitchen because it is dominated by the low frequency. A simulation of a indoor situation with 2 speaker array is a living room is done in \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_60_100} and \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_200_300}
 




\subsection{Monitoring}
Using a normal loudspeaker as a stage monitor might lead to some complications, where the monitor and the microphone create a feedback loop or the performer is ignored by the neighbour performer monitor. The beamforming array cannot solve the feedback loop, but the beamforming array will lower the pressure in side of the monitor at low frequency and might have an useful effect. This application both have a posential at stage inside and outside. The problem of using this inside can be that the reflection is so strong that the effect do not work as intended. Another problem with monitor might be that the stage is small and there is barely space for the monitor. By adding additional input and filter for different direction of the beamforming array, it might be possible to take away three monitors and replace them by one beamforming array on such small stage. By narrow the front beam and allow higher beam at the back the sound might be possible to point on the performer as wanted. This kind of bemforming require further investigation and designing which not is done in this project. A simulation is made of a indoor application where two monitors of the beemforming array are placed on a stage, see \autoref{sec:dis:simulation}



\subsection{Main application}
The main application of the beamforming array was intended to outdoor venue, where the neighbour was the non voluntary listener. In this application where the speaker is under free field condition, it have been shown that the sound pressure can be attenuated at least \SI{-9}{\decibel} at the back and side of the array. Therefore the beamforming array will help damping the this kind of side effect of outdoor concert.


\subsection{Simulation}\label{sec:dis:simulation}
The aim of this section is to shortly investigate the wave behaver of the speaker array inside with wall reflection. This project have covered the design of the beamforming array and the behaver in free field condition. The indoor application have been keep out of interest, because of the starting point of application, which have been focused on outdoor event. The last point in the introduction was questioning the indoor application of the beamforming array. At this point there is many possibility since every room is different. The room could be a big concert hall or just a small room for living. It have been chosen to simulate a concert hall because of the monitoring application and the living room for home application. For the living room, it have been chosen to use a standard listening room of size (\SI{4.15}{\meter} x \SI{7.8}{\meter}) which correspond to the \gls{aau} standard listening room. All simulation will be done in 2 dimension because of the computation time and memory requirement. It will not give the exact simulation of the room, but since the reflection coefficient of the room wall not is measured there is already many unknown parameters in this simulation. The reflection in this simulation is done where the $Z_{-1}$ and $Z_{1}$ is unknown and set to zero, because in many case the characteristic wall impedance $Z_0$ is the predominant part \citep{fdtd_imp}. $Z_0$ can be approximated with using the absorbing coefficient \citep{fdtd_imp}. The following \autoref{eq:absorb} shows the approximated characteristic wall impedance $Z_0$ calculation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:absorb}
Z_0 = \rho c \frac{1+\sqrt{1-\alpha}}{1-\sqrt{1-\alpha}}
\end{equation}

 The simulation give an impression of the wave behaviour in the room and not valid result. The result from a simulation of a size like the listening room is shown in \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_60_100} and \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_200_300}

\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_60_100} and \autoref{fig:Indoor_simulation_200_300} it can be seen that the pressure in the room is not even ether with beamforming active or not. But one notable thing is that the pressure in the room at low frequency with omnidirectional array gets very high compare to higher frequency. So the room amplify the low frequency with reflection more that in the higher frequency area. The pressure seems to be more frequency pressure constant with beamforming active compare to beamforming disabled.\\


A second indoor application is the monitoring. In a monitoring application the room tens to be larger than a living room. The use of monitoring is often at both small and big concert where both dedicated concert hall and sports arenas are used. The following simulating example are done in a sports arena where the spectator area at sports event are on the long side of the playing field. A handball playing field do have a size of (\SI{20}{\meter}x\SI{40}{\meter}) and in this case the spectator is \SI{5}{\meter} on both long side. The following simulation \autoref{fig:Indoor_monitor_60_300} shows a simulation where the stage is placed on the top of the simulation with two monitor. Both monitors is playing upwards when looking at the simulation.

\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:Indoor_monitor_60_300} it can be seen that the two monitor playing cardioid mostly have an effect on the audience and do not change much on stage. On change to the monitoring system might be that those two monitors was changed with only one beamforming monitor, but feeded with to signals and different beamforming. So one signal is playing to the left of the monitor, there the other signal was playing to the right. This concept have not been tested but it might be one possibility for change of the beamforming system.
