\section{The Equipment in Use}\label{sec:hardware}
The aim of this chapter is to document building a speaker stand for measuring the polar response of the speaker array. The requirement for the stand is that the it is able to be fixed to the turntable. A drawing of the turntable is illustrates the usable mounting points in \autoref{fig:turn_table}


 \begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}



The drawing of the turntable in \autoref{fig:turn_table} shows that the turning part of the turntable has a diameter of \SI{350}{\milli\meter}. The speaker construction shall at least have a diameter of \SI{1.1}{\meter}, such that loudspeakers can be mounted in a way, that separates the acoustical centers by \SI{400}{\milli\meter}. To achieve more stability for the speaker stand, the rotating part of the turntable is extended by a circular wood plate with a diameter of \SI{800}{\milli\meter}. The circular plate is bolted to the eight M8 screw holes seen in \autoref{fig:turn_table}. \\
To be able to support the rather heavy loudspeakers on the wooden plate, a metal speaker stand has been designed. The profile of the speaker stand has to be as small as possible to avoid reflection from construction, but is shall be rigid enough the hold the speaker in a constant position relative to eachother. Therefore it has been chosen to use squared metal pipe (box section) for the construction. The construction is built such that the speaker is raised at least \SI{1}{\meter} from the wood plate, to avoid reflections.\\
The placement of the loudspeakers has to be adjustable. Because the speaker cabinets are placed close to each other, the way they possible inflict the sound field is unknown and some compensation by altering the loudspeaker positions may be required. Therefore the metal frame is divided intro a bottom part and three stand parts. The reason for splitting the stand and the bottom frame is achieving adjustability. To make the adjustable features possible, the bottom part is build out of \SI{45}{\milli\meter} box section and the stand part is built of \SI{40}{\milli\meter} box section. This enables the stand to be slid intro the bottom part. To achieve higher stability, the outer \SI{200}{\milli\meter} of bottom part is cut out as a 'u' shape as visualized in \autoref{fig:botom_u}

 \begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bottom_u}
	\caption{The bottom part of the speaker stand with the u cut}

\end{figure}

The acoustic centers of the loudspeakers have to be placed in a triangular shape, where it has been chosen to make the centroid the array center (see \autoref{sec:genetic_implementation},\autoref{ax:directional_3}). This placement leads to a weight bias towards the direction, where the back speaker is placed, rotational axis of the turntable. Therefore a small plate is mounted in the front, such that is possible to mount a counterweight to the speaker stand. The constructional drawing of the bottom part of the speaker stand is given in \autoref{fig:botom_final}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{bottom_final}
	\caption{Constructional drawing of array mounting system, bottom part.}

\end{figure}

The corresponding loudspeaker stands are made in an 'L' shape, where the horizontal part of the L can be slid into the formerly mentioned bottom part and the vertical part is used as the height extender, which holds the speaker is on top. The adjustability of the speaker stands also means, that before any measurement can be conducted, the loudspeaker positions have to be carefully tuned to the desired specifications. The following \autoref{fig:the_setup} shows the full speaker setup in the anechoic chamber at \gls{aau}.

	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{the_setup}

\end{figure}

The rigidity of the speaker stand construction is insufficient to keep the loudspeakers in precise positions relative to eachother. Therefore a triangular wooden piece is added, connection the top sides of all the loudspeakers. The construction tends to oscillate for a time of roughly \SI{2}{\second} after the turntable stops rotating, before the loudspeaker settle. With addition of the top wood plate, the position of the speakers sufficiently precise. However, the adding the top plate also leads to another parameter, that has to be adjusted before measurements, in order to insure, that the main axis of the speakers is on the horizontal plane. 
The top plate is shown in \autoref{fig:array_pic}. The figure also gives an impression about the spacing and sizes of the speaker cabinets.

\section{Conclusion on hardware design}
With the formerly disclosed construction, it is possible to set up a loudspeaker array according to the requirements for the placement of the acoustic centers from \autoref{ssec:cost_map}. The setup is mostly suited to a laboratory environment as it requires careful adjustments before any measurement or demonstration. Account for adjustments in the construction should enable the contraption to be suitable for a variety of speaker configurations.
%It can be concluded that it was possible to make a stable speaker measuring stand where all three speaker can be allined and adjusted and still be a stable construction.
