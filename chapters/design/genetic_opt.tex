\section{Problem Description}
In order to realize a directional low-mid emission with the chosen speaker configuration, signal parameters have to be chosen in a specific manner. The directional characteristics of the speaker array depend on the amplitude and phase of the signal that is transduced via the individual speakers. The resulting directional characteristics of a given set of signal-parameters can be described by the use of a analytical model, that has been supplemented with knowledge from measuring the polar response of the speakers.\\
Assuming, that the model describing the directional characteristics of the array, is sufficiently accurate, it is possible to form an optimization problem. Any set of \gls{sp} parameters can be evaluated by plugging it into the supplemented analytical model. Solutions, that resemble the desired directional characteristic are considered optimal.\\
The supplemented analytical model describes intricate physical behaviour and is related to the desired behaviour of the speaker array.  This makes it favourable to approach the given problem with combinatorial optimization. Specifically, it has been chosen to handle the problem with a \gls{ga}, where the supplemented analytical model used to evaluate the \textit{fitness}.
