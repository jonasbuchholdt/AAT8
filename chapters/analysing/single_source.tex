\section{Single source}\label{ch:single_speaker_source}
To gain understanding about the interaction of several sources emitting sound simultaneously it is essential to first investigate the behaviour of a single sound source. In the context of this project loudspeakers are investigated. The goal of this section is to find a way to represent the sound emission of loudspeakers within the frequencies boundaries of this project (\SIrange{60}{300}{\hertz}).
The representation must be suffiencently accurate yet relatively simple to calculate in order to be useful in the optimization process that is a later part of this project (see \autoref{ch:optimization}).

%This section aims to introduce and analyse the fundamental for a single source, by analyse the behaviour of a baffled circular plane piston source. The pressure around the piston source will be analysed analytically, to determine the radiation of a single speaker from \SI{60}{\hertz} and upwards and compare it with the measurement from \autoref{ch:polar_response}. The \SI{60}{\hertz} lower limit enable the simulation to be validated by measurement in the AAU anechoic chamber and is a used lower limit for the low/mid driver in some line source array \citep{V-DOSC}.  The analyse shall end out with a approximated simulation model of the \gls{dut}.
\subsection{Pressure emission from an omidirectional source}\label{ssec:omni}
As explained in \autoref{ch:polar_response} loudspeakers are commonly treated as omnidirectional sources at low frequencies. Taking advantage of this approximation, the sound pressure emission in free field conditions can be described conveniently. \citep[p. 171]{Kinsler2000} state the following equation \autoref{eq:omni_source} for a pulsating sphere. It has to be noted, that the position of the sphere in the given case is the acoustic center of the loudspeaker (see \autoref{sec:ac_center}).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:omni_source}
p(r,t)\,=\,\rho_0 c V_0 \left(\frac{a}{r}\right)\cos \theta_a \textbf{\textit{e}}^{j\left(\omega t - k(r-a)+\theta_a\right)}

\subsection{Pressure emission from a baffled piston}\label{ssec:piston}
Another  approach to analytically approximate the behaviour of a cone loudspeaker is given by \citep[p. 179 ff.]{Kinsler2000}, where the behaviour of the sound radiated from a plane circular piston surrounded by an infinte rigid baffle is described. The piston model is derived from the model of a continous line source as described in \citep[p. 176 f.]{Kinsler2000}.


%To characterize the directional properties of an analytical model of the \gls{dut}, the source will be modulated in two dimension as one baffled circular plane piston source. The analysis of a piston source in two dimension built on a thin piston source in three dimension where the x axis is fixed in the plot. This is possible because of vertical beam patten symmetry of \autoref{fig:continues_line_source} \citep{Kinsler2000}. The piston lays flat down so i look like a line source and have radius $a$. The baffled circular plane piston source can be considered as many continuous line sources, which detonate dx and is pointing towards the reader on \autoref{fig:continues_line_source}. The calculated pressure point will be in far field where $r>>a$ holds and the surface integral can be rewritten to a Bessel function \citep{Kinsler2000}. The pressure formula is therefore:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:piston_source}
p(r,\theta ,t)=\frac{j}{2} \rho_{0}c  V_{0}\frac{a}{r}ka \left ( \frac{2J_1(ka\, sin(\theta ))}{ka\, sin(\theta )} \right )e^{j(\omega t-kr)}
\end{equation}

A major disadvantage to utlizing the piston model in the context of the project is, that no information about the cabinet of the \gls{dut} is incorporated. The concept of an infinite rigid baffle leads to results that are axis symmetric along the \SIrange{-90}{90}{\degree}-line in a polar plot. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:piston_analytical}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{piston.eps}
	\caption{Normed SPL according to \autoref{eq:piston_source}, $a=165.3$\si{\milli\meter}$\,\approx 13$'', corresponding to the size of \citep{seas33}.}
		\label{fig:piston_analytical}
\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:piston_analytical} displays almost perfect omnidirectional behaviour for lower frequencies and lowering pressure towards $\pm$\SI{90}{\degree} for higher frequencies. The deviation from omnidirectionality has the same qualitative appearance as the measured pressure curves in \autoref{fig:03_02_pressure_main}, however they significantly differ in numbers. The phase of the speaker is shown in  \autoref{fig:03_02_m1_phase_main}  
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{03_02_meas1_pressure.eps}

		\label{fig:03_02_m1_phase_main}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:03_02_pressure_main} also illustrates, that the solutions obtained with \autoref{eq:piston_source} do not realistically represent how the pressure is emitted on the back side of the speaker. Specifically, the indents in the in the curves for frequencies $\ge$\SI{200}{\hertz} at approx. $\pm$\SI{125}{\hertz} in \autoref{fig:03_02_pressure_main} deviate from the shape that is drawn by the piston model.

%\subsection{Comparison: calculations based on the baffled piston and measured polar respone}
%In this section, the \gls{dut} will be simulated as a baffled circular plane piston source as described in \autoref{ch:single_speaker_source} and compared to the actually measurement of the \gls{dut} \autoref{ax:directional_2}.

\subsection{Fitting the omnidirectional source model to the \gls{dut}}\label{sec:correction}
The analytical descriptions of both the pulsating sphere (see \autoref{ssec:omni}) and the piston (see \autoref{ssec:piston}) do not describe the measured behaviour of the \gls{dut} in an adequate manner. In order to be able to perfom an optimization of the signal processing parameters for the speaker array (see \autoref{ch:optimization}), a sufficient model has to be obtained. For the sake of this project, it has been chosen to rely on measured data.
As the pressure and phase characteristic of the \gls{dut} have been ascertained in measurements (see Appendices \ref{ax:directional_1},\ref{ax:directional_2}), the measurements results can be processed to obtain a correction table relating to the model of the omnidirectional source. This is achieved by calculating a difference of the measured data from the ideal values, that would suggest omnidirectionality at any given frequency. The resolution of the correction grid is determined by angular resolution and the frequency resolution of the polar response measurement, that it is based on.  \autoref{fig:correction_3d} shows a pressure correction grid, based on the polar response from Appendix \ref{ax:directional_2}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{correction_3d.eps}
	\caption{Contour plot of the pressure correction data, based on measurement data from Appendix \ref{ax:directional_2}}
		\label{fig:correction_3d}
\end{figure}
With the correction values applied, an augmented form of \autoref{eq:omni_source} can be established. Note, that while the deviation from omnidirectionality is visualized in \autoref{fig:correction_3d} in a \si{\decibel}-scale, for the usage in the \textsf{Dev}-function in \autoref{eq:aug_omni}, data has to be presented linearly.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aug_omni}
p(r,t)\,=\,\rho_0 c V_0 \left(\frac{a}{r}\right)\cos \theta_a \textbf{\textit{e}}^{j\left(\omega t - k(r-a)+\theta_a\right)}\cdot\textsf{Dev}(f,\phi)

\section{Two speaker in a line}\label{sec:first_order_speaker}
The aim of this section is to do an analysis of a well known and used low frequency beamforming technique with two speakers. It can be seen in \autoref{ssec:piston} the single speaker is nearly omnidirectional both in phase and pressure. Because the phase is omnidirectional as the pressure, it is possible to place the two speaker in a line with a shift phase, such that it will make the phase in front of both speaker to match up where the back phase is in uperset  direction. This means that the pressure in the front is added together and the pressure in back is subtracted from each other. This beamforming technique is the First order gradient speaker arrray \citep{olson1973gradient} which also are named as the Two-Element In-Line Technique \citep{McCarthy2016}. This technique make one able to make cardioid low frequency array with only 2 speakers where both speaker is playing forward. The benefit of placing the speaker on a forward line is that the phase between the two speaker can be controlled such that the pressure at the back is lowered compare to the pressure at the front. One arising problem with this technique is that the speaker position is constant no matter which frequency the speaker is playing, and therefore this array is only optimal in the tuned frequency where the distance between the speaker and the phase is designed to work. Outside this exact frequency the front pressure will drop unless the both speaker plays with the same pressure. This problem is arising because the front phase between the to speaker do not is \SI{0}{\degree} in the front anymore. The following \autoref{fig:gradient_problem} shows the frequency response characteristic of such array where the back speaker is operating in \SI{180}{\degree} related to the front speaker.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{first_order_speaker.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic diagram, frequency response characteristic, and polar directional characteristics of a unidirectional first-order gradient sound radiator. \citep{olson1973gradient}}
		\label{fig:gradient_problem}
\end{figure}

It can be seen in the frequency response in \autoref{fig:gradient_problem} that the technique works best when the relation between the distance between the two speaker $D$ and the wavelength $\lambda$ is $0.5$. When the relation between $D$ and $\lambda$ grows higher that $0.5$ the beamforming shape starts to radiate sidewise instead of to the front. When the relation is less than $0.5$ the beamforming keep the cardioid shape, but the front pressure drops. This indicate that it is the highest frequency that shall determined the distance between the speaker with the $D$ and $\lambda$ relation, such that all frequency have the cardioid shape.\\ 

This method do enable the speaker array to radiate in a cardioid shape, but the direction of the cardioid shape can only be controlled forward and backwards and not in any other direction.

\section{Conclusion of sound source}
Investigating analytical ways to express the behaviour of a speaker by incorporation no other information then its size leads to results that are not particulary accurate and are therefore of limited use. While it appears to be possible to get better estimates by incorporating more information into a numerical model (e.g. \citep{vanderkooy10}). The given objective of using the model for an optimization makes this approach unfeasible. Because measurements have been conducted investigating the directional characteristics of the loudspeaker that will later be used, a more empirical approach has been found. Exploiting information from the measurements, the relatively simple model of a pulsating sphere can be augmented, so that it fits the behaviour of the \gls{dut}. A first-order use of the speaker have further been analysed where it have been founded that the first order loudspeaker array is able to do beamforming with cardioid shape. unfortneliy the first order loudspeaker array is only able to do cardioid shape in the frontal and backwards direction and cannot angle the beam with software. Another beamforming array have to be analysed and used for this project.
