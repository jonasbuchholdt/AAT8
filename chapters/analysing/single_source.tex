\section{Single source}\label{ch:single_speaker_source}
To gain understanding about the interaction of several sources emitting sound simultaneously it is essential to first investigate the behaviour of a singular sound source. In the context of this project loudspeakers are investigated. The goal of this section is to find a way to represent the sound emission of loudspeakers within the frequencies boundaries of this project (\SIrange{60}{300}{\hertz}).
The representation must be suffiencently accurate yet relatively simple to calculate in order to be useful in the optimization process that is a later part of this project (see \autoref{ch:optimization}).

%This section aims to introduce and analyse the fundamental for a single source, by analyse the behaviour of a baffled circular plane piston source. The pressure around the piston source will be analysed analytically, to determine the radiation of a single speaker from \SI{60}{\hertz} and upwards and compare it with the measurement from \autoref{ch:polar_response}. The \SI{60}{\hertz} lower limit enable the simulation to be validated by measurement in the AAU anechoic chamber and is a used lower limit for the low/mid driver in some line source array \citep{V-DOSC}.  The analyse shall end out with a approximated simulation model of the \gls{dut}.
\subsection{Pressure emission from an omidirectional source}
As explained in \autoref{ch:polar_response} loudspeakers are commonly treated as omnidirectional sources at low frequencies. Taking advantage of this approximation, the sound pressure emission in free field conditions can be described conveniently. \citep[p. 171]{Kinsler2000} state the following equation \autoref{eq:omni_source} for a pulsating sphere. It has to be noted, that the position of the sphere in the given case is the acoustic center of the loudspeaker (see \autoref{sec:ac_center}).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:omni_source}
p(r,t)\,=\,\rho_0 c V_0 \left(\frac{a}{r}\right)\cos \theta_a \textbf{\textit{e}}^{j\left(\omega t - k(r-a)+\theta_a\right)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pressure emission from a baffled piston}
Another  approach to analytically approximate the behaviour of a cone loudspeaker is given by \citep[p. 179 ff.]{Kinsler2000}, where the behaviour of the sound radiated from a plane circular piston surrounded by an infinte rigid baffle is described.


%To characterize the directional properties of an analytical model of the \gls{dut}, the source will be modulated in two dimension as one baffled circular plane piston source. The analysis of a piston source in two dimension built on a thin piston source in three dimension where the x axis is fixed in the plot. This is possible because of vertical beam patten symmetry of \autoref{fig:continues_line_source} \citep{Kinsler2000}. The piston lays flat down so i look like a line source and have radius $a$. The baffled circular plane piston source can be considered as many continuous line sources, which detonate dx and is pointing towards the reader on \autoref{fig:continues_line_source}. The calculated pressure point will be in far field where $r>>a$ holds and the surface integral can be rewritten to a Bessel function \citep{Kinsler2000}. The pressure formula is therefore:

\begin{equation}
p(r,\theta ,t)=\frac{j}{2} \rho_{0}c  V_{0}\frac{a}{r}ka \left ( \frac{2J_1(ka\, sin(\theta ))}{ka\, sin(\theta )} \right )e^{j(\omega t-kr)}
\end{equation}
Where the complete surface vibration is described with

\begin{equation}
v = V_{0} \cdot exp(j \omega t)
\end{equation}

        \explain{$\omega$ is the angular velocity }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$t$ is the time }{\si{1}}
\stopexplain
    
Each small sources is treated as an baffled simple source with a width of $dx$ and the source strange can be modulated as following      

\begin{equation}
dQ = V_{0} 2 a\, sin(\phi) \, dx
\end{equation}

The following \autoref{fig:continues_line_source} shows an example of the continues line source where one of the small source is showed with width $dx$ and length $2a \, sin(\phi)$.
