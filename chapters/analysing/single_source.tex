\section{Single speaker source}
This section aims to introduce and analyse the fundamental for a single source, by analyse the behaviour of a piston source. The pressure around the piston source will be analysed analytically, to determine the radiation of a single speaker from \SI{60}{\hertz} and upwards and compare it with the measurement from \autoref{ch:polar_response}. The \SI{60}{\hertz} lower limit enable the simulation to be validated by measurement in the AAU anechoic chamber and is a used lower limit for the low/mid driver in some line source array \citep{V-DOSC}.  The analyse shall end out with a approximated simulation model of the \gls{dut}.

\subsection{Pressure analysis around a single source}
To characterised the directions properties of an analytical model of the \gls{dut}, the source will be modulated in two dimension as one piston source. The analysis of a piston source in to dimension built on a thin piston source in three dimension where the z dimension is fixed. The piston lays flat down so i look like a line and have radius $a$. The piston source will be considered as many small sources, where the complete surface vibrate radially with speed

\begin{equation}
u = \text{\textit{{\LARGE u}}}_{0} \cdot exp(j \omega t)
\end{equation}

    		\explain{$u$ is the complex speed of the line source }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$\text{\textit{{\LARGE u}}}_{0}$ is the Amplitude}{\si{1}}
        \explain{$j$ is the imaginary unit }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$\omega$ is the angular velocity }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$t$ is the time }{\si{1}}

Each small sources is treated as an unbaffled simple source with length $dx$ and the source strange can be modulated as following      

\begin{equation}
dQ = \text{\textit{{\LARGE u}}}_{0} 2 \pi a \cdot dx
\end{equation}

    		\explain{$dQ$ is the simple source strange }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$\text{\textit{{\LARGE u}}}_{0}$ is the Amplitude}{\si{1}}
        \explain{$a$ is the radius for cylinder }{\si{1}}
        \explain{$dx$ is the length for the simple source }{\si{1}}
    \stopexplain    
 
The following \autoref{fig:continues_line_source} shows an example of the continues line source where one of the small source is showed with length $dx$.
