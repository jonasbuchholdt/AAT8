\section{Single speaker source}
This section aims to introduce and analyse the fundamental for a single source, by analyse the behaviour of a linesource shaped as the diaphragm. The pressure around the speaker will be analysed analytically, to determine the radiation of a single speaker from \SI{60}{\hertz} and upwards. The \SI{60}{\hertz} lower limit enable the simulation to be validated by measurement in the AAU anacoid chamber and is a used lower limit for the low/mid driver in some line source array.  The analyse shall end out with a limited frequency range, where the directivity have to be controlled.

\subsection{Pressure analysis around a single source}
To characterised the directions properties of a single source, the source will be modulated as a linesource shaped as the diaphragm of a speaker. To
