One of the most known instruments in the world and maybe the one that most people play is the guitar. The two main categories of guitars are the acoustic guitars and the electric guitar, with millions of players having the one, the other or both. If one is playing the electric guitar one will quickly find that to get the real feeling of being a guitarist, some additions have to be made to the setup. The first step might be an amplifier, but once the taste for guitar gear has awaken, the next natural step will be to buy effects for the guitar. Guitar effects can be an integrated part of an amplifier, but guitar effects can also be bought as isolated effects pedals or as multi effect boards. The two "religions" within guitar effects are the analog effects and the digital effects, where the analog ones often are more expensive than the digital ones. 
This project will aim to make a system that will work as one or more guitar effects. In \autoref{fig:real_life_drawing} a real life drawing of the system is illustrated.

The \autoref{fig:real_life_drawing} shows a signal from a guitar, going through the system and sent to an amplifier. The person playing the guitar should be able to choose which effect the system should make and also be able to change different parameters on the chosen effect. 



\section{Initial problem statement}
The following questions are made with the intention of gathering the necessary knowledge, to be able to answer a later stated problem statement. The initial questions, which will be answered in the analysis, are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Which parameters can be adjusted on an electric guitar, in order to adjust the sound?
\item Which effects can be applied to the signal from an electric guitar and how do they work?
\item Which platforms can be used for the implementation of the above mentioned effects? 
\end{itemize}
