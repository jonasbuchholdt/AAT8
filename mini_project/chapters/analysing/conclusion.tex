\chapter{Conclusion}
Within in the context of the mini-project at hand, a sound field simulation has been implemented using a \gls{fdtd}-based method. Investigations regarding precision and performance have been conducted. It has been established, that in an acoustical context, there is no point in using double precision variables instead of single precision. 

The chosen development plan (modified waterfall model) turned out to be a suitable choice for the given project. This might have been due to the clear target definition and the small number of participants, which made it easy to keep track of the development. For more complex software projects a more agile approach might be better suited.
