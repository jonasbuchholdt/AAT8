\subsection{Refactoring}\label{ssec:refactoring}
Refactoring has partly been an element of the mini project, because there were different implementations (naive,
\subsection{Optimization}\label{ssec:optimization}
One of the tasks listed in the problem description for the mini-project involves implementing the algorithm in a way, that parallel processing is used. This can be done for \gls{fdtd}-simulation. However, because of the nature of the computational tasks, it takes a great deal of effort to make an implementation using parallel computing on the CPU, that comes even remotely close to a well designed implementation without the explicit use of parallel computing.
However, it might be possible to implement the simulation on a GPU and gain performance by doing so.
